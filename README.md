# My development environment

Welcome! This repository contains all the scripts and configurations (dotfiles and other files that don't start with a dot :) of my computer.

If you want to have my computer you can start reading the `my_computer/README.md`.
Apart from the installation of those basic programs, here I include all my relevant Dockerfiles.
For example, the Python environment I currently use is created using the files under `docker_python`.


## Disclaimer

Obviously, having the software of my computer will not turn you into me.
I don't have a repository for that, I'm sorry bro.
