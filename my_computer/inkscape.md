## Key

* Crop using a rectangle:
  * Paint a rectangle on top of what do you want to crop.
  * Select all the elements with Ctrl + A.
  * Go to Object > Clip > Set.
* Fit page to figure with Ctrl + Shift + R.
* Change view using numbers.
4 and 5 are the better views for me.
* Select a color with Shift to change the stroke color.
